                I attended the monthly meetup for San Antonio Coders at the Friendly Spot on Tuesday, May 3rd. One of the attendees was a mechanical engineer. He said his day-to-day work involved working with PLCs (programmable logic controllers) to aid in the production of slurpee machines. He mainly coded in Ruby and Node JS. Another attendee works at an interactive company and is currently on a project for a product that allows a camera on a tripod, for instance, to follow a person doing an activity like wake boarding. Unlike a GoPro which has to be statically mounted, the product he described tracks movement and records the user in action.

                Listening to these people talk about their work and how some of the tools Iâ€™m familiar with, like Node JS and React JS, are used in their work was encouraging. I wanted to attend a meetup to see people in the tech community first-hand. People interact constantly online about coding with has been a great help, but I also want to sit with people to get a sense of personalities I may work with in the near future. I am looking for my next meetup to be focused on javascript because I want to hear how people use certain lexical words in conversation.
